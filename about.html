                <p>Abby(on the left) and Melina(on the right) originally met when they were about 4, they were next door neighbors growing up. <br> <br>
                    Their first encounter was initiated by Melina driving around in her pink Barbie Jeep. Abby noticed Melina from across the road and was intrigued by 
                    the toy car and the possibility of a new friend. Abby said to her mom, "Who is that girl? Let's go meet that girl." The rest was history and they formed a bond that won't ever be broken.
                Now that they're adults they're feeling ambitious and are eager to pursue their dreams. Starting a business is a huge milestone for them and a great stepping stone into their futures.
            They're reliable, hardworking, and their energy is contagious. They're so grateful for all their clients and look forward to meeting you</p>

                    <p>Hello, my name is Melina Johnson and I'm 22 years old. <br><br> For me, cleaning was mostly
                        self taught as a way to feel relaxed and
                        relieve stress. On my free time I appreciate
                        spending time with friends, family and my
                        beloved cat- Booger. My hobbies include
                        reading, coloring, and cleaning my own
                        home! My favorite tasks to tackle are the
                        ones frequently forgotten, like cabinets,
                        baseboards, toilet seat hinges, etc. I have a
                        passion for connecting with people and
                        creating a lovely living space that those can
                        feel comfortable and welcomed in.

                    <p>Hi! My name is Abby Bloecker and I am 23 years old. <br><br> When I am not cleaning houses you'll usually find me lifting weights, reading a
                        book, or crafting! I have always been a very
                        tidy person and used to be the kid that would
                        offer to clean my friends rooms when I went
                        over to hang out. My favorite thing to clean is
                        stove knobs and copper sinks. Fun fact about
                        me is that I am also a certified personal
                        trainer!</p>
